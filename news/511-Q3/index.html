                Reports have come through from the Western reaches of the Emerald Sea. It is now known that the United Kingdom of the Vislands has launched a military operation against the Republic of Datin and has now taken control of the island of Toma. No such attack upon the nations' land border has yet been attempted.
                <br><br>
                The reports have also indicated the "crippled" nature of the Datin Navy, with the sea said to be littered with shipwrecks bearing the nation's flag. The Vislandian navy has also been seen using various Olympian manufactured weapons, particularly anti-ship rockets and missiles. In addition to this, the Olympian government has confirmed that it has provided "minor air support" to the Vislandians during their invasion.
                <br><br>
                The Olympian government has now extended the naval blockade to the northern entrance of the Emerald Sea, barring ships all from entering unless they submit to boarded inspections by the Olympian Navy. This blockade has been echoed by Ignara Olympia which has implemented an almost identical measure in the southern entrance of the Eridania Crater.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                Following the reports from the Emerald Sea, the nations of the Ryland Republic, Sinitria, the Republic of Vemya, Mafri, the Caron Kingdom, and Theziland have come together to form the Echoan Defence Pact. The agreement between the nations is such that they have pledged to defend one another in the face of an outside aggressor. The nations have begun standardising and sharing military technology, as well as started various military cooperation exercises.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                Veneran and Satrujan military forces have almost completed the predicted encirclement manoeuvre and are close to cutting off the southern, and most populated region of the Kingdom of Tyrella from access to the nation's northern coast. According to military experts, the encirclement has advanced at an "unprecedented pace" and it is thought that upon its completion the Veneran Army will likely continue advancing northwards from the southern coast in an attempt to completely capture and subdue the Tyrellan seat of government.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                A major rare earth mine has collapsed in the Risanov Kingdom. Casualties are currently unknown however rescue efforts have now been underway for more than a month. The mine represented a significant portion of the nation's and world's output of rare earth metals and it is believed that the collapse will decrease supplies by up to 15%, particularly or Cerium and Neodymium.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                Statement from the MAC government:
                <br><br>
                "This year, the MAC has both the Parliamentary elections in each of the three constituent republics, as well as the overall election of the Executive Council. The incumbent party, the Republican Conservative Party (RCP) had been declining in popularity in the past years.
                <br><br>
                However, a string of domestic and international successes in the past several months, as well as the passing of several reformative policies (seen mainly as concessions to the other parties to lobby voters) have allowed the RCP to narrowly maintain its absolute two-thirds majorities in the three Parliaments of the Constituent Republics, as well as have RCP candidates holding the positions of the three Prime Ministers in the Executive Council.
                <br><br>
                The ceremony swearing in the three Prime Ministers of the Constituent Republics occurs soon after the election results are announced."
