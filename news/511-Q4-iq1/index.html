            <p class="con-article-content">
                The MAC and CEC have stated that they are "deeply saddened about the loss of lives during the mine collapse in the Risanov Kingdom, and give their condolences to all the families affected." The MAC is willing to aid the Risanov Kingdom with rescue efforts in the short term, as well as efforts to reconstruct the collapsed mines in order to bring global rare earth metal supplies back to their prior levels at the earliest possible. The MAC and CEC governments also clarified that these measures would also "be in compliance with standards outlined in Risanovi legislation."

            <p class="con-article-content">
                Following their previous success with signing a deal between the CEC and the Millar State, the MAC approached the Ortivan Kingdoms and the Republic of Lichona to see whether they are willing to sign separate trade deals with the CEC. These would primarily involve a mutual lowering of tariffs (down to only 5% on the CEC nations' end, and halving whatever previous tariff rates were previously in place on their end). The goal of these proposed deals was to increase trade across the Cimmeran Sea as a part of the MAC's efforts to economically revitalise the region and take a step away from conflict. The deal was accepted and signed by the Republic of Lichona, however narrowly rejected by a vote held in the Ortivan Kingdoms.
