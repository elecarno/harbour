            <h1 class="lbl-header">EMERALD SEA FISHING VESSELS ATTACKED</h1>
            <p class="con-article-content">
                <img class="img-article" src="../../assets/news/510-Q4_1.jpg">
                Fishing vessels in the west of the Emerald Sea have been experiencing a series of attacks, with many ships highly damaged and crew injured. There have been six fatalities reported, however these are thus far unconfirmed. The attacks have occurred around the island of Toma, which is controlled by the Republic of Datin, however the island itself is a common base of operations for fishing crews from multiple nations looking to catch certain deep-water Emerald Sea fish which are difficult to find on the coasts.
                <br><br>
                There are currently varying reports as to who is conducted the attacks, however residents of Toma and the crews of the affected fishing vessels themselves have all pointed to the Kingdom of the Vislands to the west. International aid groups have been unable to access Toma as the New Olympian State has currently enacted an airspace restriction over the island and much of the Republic of Datin itself. The Olympian Navy has also setup a naval blockade to the east of the Olympus-Datin border. This comes only a week after the Olympian government declared that it would be placing economic sanctions on the Republic of Datin in retaliation for Datinian fishing vessels overfishing in Olympian waters and economically undercutting Olympian fisheries.
                <br><br>
                Reports indicate that the attacks on fishing vessels are being conducted using small boats equipped with machine guns, as well as undersea anti-ship mines. Such mines would have to be launched from destroyers or submarines, however there have been no reported sightings of destroyer-sized vessels near Toma. The only nation in the region known to operate a sizeable submarine fleet is the New Olympian State.
                <br><br>
                Despite the dangers, the fishermen of Toma are still venturing out to catch fish. With the Olympian naval blockade in place, the Republic of Datin cannot import fish from other coastal countries such as the Kingdom of Alrevia or the Emirian Republic. The country is known for its staple seafood dishes and more than half of all restaurants in the nation's capital operate on these recipes. Some emergency imports have made it to the country from Ryland Republic, however this raises prices significantly as shipping by train is far costlier than over water, and shipments going through the Bronze Mountains are often stopped by dated infrastructure or landslides.
                <br><br>
                The nearby nations of Theziland, the Caron Kingdom, Mafri, and the Republic of Vemya, have all issued a joint statement condemning the New Olympian State for their naval blockade and have requested that it be lifted, citing the major economic damage it is doing to the region. The Olympian government has thus far refused to respond to this statement. The Vislandian government has also vehemently denied any involvement in the attacks on Toman fishing vessels.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                Leaders from the island nation of Caripatha in the Bronze Gulf made a state visit to the Republic of Ladum in order to begin discussions on a deal that would allow for joint military operations between the two nations on the island of Baradun. Political experts in many nations across the region of Lasselia had formerly speculated for weeks that such a deal may have been in consideration, citing various maritime security concerns surrounding the growing presence of the Vislandian Navy in the Bronze Gulf. Few details on the current progress of the negotiations or the potential nature of the deal itself have been released, however a joint press-release is expected sometime within the next month following the meeting.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                Sugar plantations in the Kingdom of Danewa have been hit by an emergent fungal disease which has devastated sugar production across the country. This has majorly impacted the nation's economy which relies highly on agricultural exports. The price of sugar in the region has risen greatly and businesses are searching for alternatives. The Eridanian State has increased exports of its own sugar, however this alone will be unable to meet demand.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                In a recent state visit, the People's Republic of Venera agreed to sell roughly 250,000 units of various pieces of military equipment to the Dorsan Republic. The sudden deal (which was not listed as part of the public agenda of discussion for the visit) has surprised many living in the region, with even experts perplexed as to what the purpose of such an agreement might be. The Venerans and Dorsans are known to have maintained good relations for almost three decades now, and neither country faces any immediate threat of a major conflict. Furthermore, the Dorsan Republic, while currently experiencing a period of economic downturn, is widely expected to make a recovery within the next year. There has been no comment from the governments on either nation on the deal.

            <h1 class="lbl-header-secondary">BORDER SKIRMISH IN TYRENNA</h1>
            <p class="con-article-content">
                After four months and seventeen days the most recent ceasefire between the Satruji Republic and the Kingdom of Tyrella has once again been broken. Fighting broke out in a small town near the southern end of the border between the two nations. Initially beginning as a firefight, the conflict quickly escalated to an armoured battle when a nearby Satrujan tank squad moved to support their forces in the town. Two hours after the fighting began, the Tyrellan airforce used a guided air launched missile to eliminate the Satrujan forces and prevent them from crossing the border into Tyrella.
                <br><br>
                Shortly after the firing of the missile, leaders from both sides of the conflict spoke over the phone from secured locations, and quickly decided on another ceasefire agreement. Delegates from either nation will meet at an as of yet undisclosed location to sign and ratify the new the agreement, which will be the fifth since the beginning of the conflict between the two nations. It is currently unknown how this most recent skirmish started.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                The world's first microchip factory is set to be built in the Callistan capital. The facility will be one of the most advanced manufacturing plants in the world and represents a major investment on the part of the Callistan government, which is subsidising the project heavily. The Callistan government however has emphasised the importance of the development of the microchip (which was invented by Callistan scientists only last year) and maintaining a lead in the developing field of computing.

            <p class="con-article-content">
                The nation of Taham has accused its neighbour Havirra of having launched an "economic attack" on the nation. The Tahaminiam government has stated that it believes Havirra is using its position at the entrance of the Harberran Gulf to restrict the flow of Tahaminiam vessels to world trade. It has also cited a string of mysterious impoundments that have taken place on Tahaminiam ships at the hands of the HSSRA (Harberran Shipping Standards and Regulations Agency), which it notes the Havirran government has significant influence in.
                <br><br>
                Both nations are a part of the Harberran Economic Treaty Union (also known as HETA), a trade pact which also includes the nations of Callisterra, Alverra, Callilock, Ichver, and Kinel. Taken as a whole, HETA constitutes the 6th largest economy on the planet. The accusations made against the Harberran government are the first of their kind since the infamous "Retreat Scandal" which almost tore the economic union apart shortly after its founding in 492. Representatives from each member state of HETA are expected to meet for an emergency assembly to discuss the situation. The details of this meeting are not yet known.
