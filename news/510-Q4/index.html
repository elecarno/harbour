                Fishing vessels in the west of the Emerald Sea have been experiencing a series of attacks, with many ships highly damaged and crew injured. There have been six fatalities reported, however these are thus far unconfirmed. The attacks have occurred around the island of Toma, which is controlled by the Republic of Datin, however the island itself is a common base of operations for fishing crews from multiple nations looking to catch certain deep-water Emerald Sea fish which are difficult to find on the coasts.
                <br><br>
                There are currently varying reports as to who is conducted the attacks, however residents of Toma and the crews of the affected fishing vessels themselves have all pointed to the Kingdom of the Vislands to the west. International aid groups have been unable to access Toma as the New Olympian State has currently enacted an airspace restriction over the island and much of the Republic of Datin itself. The Olympian Navy has also setup a naval blockade to the east of the Olympus-Datin border. This comes only a week after the Olympian government declared that it would be placing economic sanctions on the Republic of Datin in retaliation for Datinian fishing vessels overfishing in Olympian waters and economically undercutting Olympian fisheries.
                <br><br>
                Reports indicate that the attacks on fishing vessels are being conducted using small boats equipped with machine guns, as well as undersea anti-ship mines. Such mines would have to be launched from destroyers or submarines, however there have been no reported sightings of destroyer-sized vessels near Toma. The only nation in the region known to operate a sizeable submarine fleet is the New Olympian State.
                <br><br>
                Despite the dangers, the fishermen of Toma are still venturing out to catch fish. With the Olympian naval blockade in place, the Republic of Datin cannot import fish from other coastal countries such as the Kingdom of Alrevia or the Emirian Republic. The country is known for its staple seafood dishes and more than half of all restaurants in the nation's capital operate on these recipes. Some emergency imports have made it to the country from Ryland Republic, however this raises prices significantly as shipping by train is far costlier than over water, and shipments going through the Bronze Mountains are often stopped by dated infrastructure or landslides.
                <br><br>
                The nearby nations of Theziland, the Caron Kingdom, Mafri, and the Republic of Vemya, have all issued a joint statement condemning the New Olympian State for their naval blockade and have requested that it be lifted, citing the major economic damage it is doing to the region. The Olympian government has thus far refused to respond to this statement. The Vislandian government has also vehemently denied any involvement in the attacks on Toman fishing vessels.
