        <h1>What is the Harbour Quarterly?</h1>
        <p>
            We are an extranational newspaper headed by journalists and reporters from the International
            journalists' Coalition. The Harbour Quarterly is was founded to allow readers to recieve
            uncensored news on the most important domestic and international issues. To ensure this quality
            we focus on publishing only four Primary Editions each year. We may also publish Interquarterly Editions
            where we feel that significant events have occured that would not fit within our usual publishing
            format, or Emergency Editions when events that put the lives of our readers in immediate danger
            have or are known to imminently to occur.
